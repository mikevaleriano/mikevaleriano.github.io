                <h2>Hick's Law</h2>
                <img src="images/hicks-law.jpeg" alt="hicks-law">
                <h3>"Keep It Short and Simple", that's one of the principles of the Hick's Law that now at days still
                    endures. In 1952 William Edmund Hick and Ray Hyman examined the relationship between the number of
                    stimuli present and an and an individualâ€™s reaction time to any given stimulus. This law influence
                    designer's work at the moment to look a fast response from the client when he's browsing a shoping
                    cart. <br> <br> Nike's website is a truly example of how to reduce client's options and just show
                    what the
                    client needs at the moment to buy shoes. In the picture we can see the website's options: Picture
                    color, Size and Add to the cart </h3>

                <h2>Rule of Thirds</h2>
                <img src="images/rule-of-thirds.jpeg" alt="rule-of-thirds">
                <h3>The Rule of Thirds tells us that when using images we must try to balance said image to capture the
                    customer's attention. These balance can be achieved by using an imaginary 4-line grid and
                    positioning it's intersections above the picture area that seeks to capture the customer's
                    attention. <br> <br> I've choosed Tesla's website for this example beacause I see that the car's
                    picture is well balanced under the central lines and on the contrary there is a counterweight in the
                    upper part of the picture that takes us to order the car. </h3>

                <img src="images/white-space.jpeg" alt="white-space">
                <h3>White space is the area between design elements. It is also the space within individual design
                    elements, including the space between typography glyphs. <br> <br>The White Space and Clean Design
                    principle
                    suggest us that we should consider the empty space as an
                    important part of our design, the white space is the canvas of our design, many times this so called
                    white space is not that color but can be black, grey, etc.</h3>
